      "title": "Safe-NEureka: a Hybrid Modular Redundant DNN Accelerator for On-board Satellite AI Processing",
      "abstract": "Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations are revolutionizing the space sector, with on-board Artificial Intelligence (AI) becoming pivotal for next-generation satellites. AI acceleration is essential for safety-critical functions such as autonomous Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC), where errors cannot be tolerated, and performance-critical processing of high-bandwidth sensor data, where occasional errors are tolerable. Consequently, AI accelerators for satellites must combine robust protection against radiation-induced faults with high throughput. This paper presents Safe-NEureka, a Hybrid Modular Redundant Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerator for heterogeneous RISC-V systems. It operates in two modes: a redundancy mode utilizing Dual Modular Redundancy (DMR) with hardware-based recovery, and a performance mode repurposing redundant datapaths to maximize parallel throughput. Furthermore, its memory interface is protected by Error Correction Codes (ECCs), and the controller by Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR). Implementation in GlobalFoundries 12nm technology shows a 96 reduction in faulty executions in redundancy mode, with a manageable 15 area overhead. In performance mode, the architecture achieves near-baseline speeds on 3x3 dense convolutions with a 5 throughput and 11 efficiency reduction, compared to 48 and 53 in redundancy mode. This flexibility ensures high overheads are limited to critical tasks, establishing Safe-NEureka as a versatile solution for space applications."

Despite its low prevalence (0.5%-3% of strokes), incidence has risen due to improved awareness and diagnostics. CVT presents variably, commonly with headache, seizures, and focal deficits, making early recognition crucial. Diagnosis relies on CT/MR venography, while anticoagulation remains the mainstay of treatment. Prognosis is generally favorable, though long-term complications such as recurrent thrombosis and cognitive impairment are possible. Emerging research continues to refine diagnostic and management strategies, including anticoagulation choices and treatment of special populations such as pregnant patients."

      "abstract": "To develop and validate a fast, motion-robust, free-breathing abdominal 3D T1ρ mapping method by combining variable-density diamond radial k-space sampling with fast-MAPSS (magnetization-prepared angle-modulated partitioned-k-space spoiled gradient-echo snapshots). 3D MAPSS T1ρ imaging was performed at 3T using five spin-lock time (TSL) pairs in phantom scans and three TSL pairs in nine healthy volunteers. Phantom experiments compared Cartesian sampling (reference) with stack-of-stars and diamond radial sampling. Volunteer scans utilized stack-of-stars and diamond sampling. T1ρ values were calculated using mono-exponential fitting with MAPSS (five or three TSL pairs) and fast-MAPSS (three TSLs). These values were compared across sampling methods and T1ρ techniques in phantom and in vivo for the liver, pancreas, and muscles. Diamond sampling achieved a 2.2-fold acceleration compared to stack-of-stars. In phantom experiments, mean T1ρ differences from reference Cartesian MAPSS were -1.93% for stack-of-stars, and -0.09% for diamond sampling. Fast-MAPSS with three TSLs resulted in differences of 0.54% (stack-of-stars) and 1.45% (diamond). In volunteers, a strong correlation (R2 ≥ 0.88) was observed between diamond and stack-of-stars MAPSS, and between MAPSS and fast-MAPSS for both sampling methods. Bland-Altman analysis revealed minimal biases (<1.5 ms) between the methods. Paired t-tests indicated no significant T1ρ differences between MAPSS and fast-MAPSS or between sampling methods in volunteers. Fast-MAPSS with diamond radial k-space sampling enables clinically feasible, motion-robust, free-breathing 3D T1ρ mapping of the abdomen with reduced scan time and quantification accuracy comparable to standard methods."

      "title": "Automated Segmentation of Complicated Cystic Renal Masses Using 3D V-Net Convolutional Neural Network on MRI.",
      "abstract": "To develop and test a convolutional neural network model for automated segmentation of complicated cystic renal masses (cCRMs) on MRI. This multicenter retrospective study analyzed 210 cCRMs between October 2019 and May 2021, divided into training/internal validation (n = 150, Institution 1) and test sets (n = 60, Institutions 2-4). Comparative 3D V-Net and U-Net models were developed across seven MRI sequences (T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, apparent diffusion coefficient maps, unenhanced T1-weighted, and enhanced corticomedullary, nephrographic, and excretory phases images). A total of 14 models were developed, and seven pairwise comparisons were performed between the 3D V-Net and U-Net models. Segmentation performance was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff distance (HD), with subgroup analysis of small cCRMs (≤40mm). In the test set, the excretory-phase V-Net (EPV-Net model) showed the highest DSC, and perform better than the corresponding U-Net (EPU-Net model) across all cCRMs (DSC: 0.74 ± 0.05 vs 0.70 ± 0.06, P < 0.001; HD: 27.41 ± 7.44 mm vs 39.18 ± 11.07 mm, P < 0.001) and the 35 small cCRMs subgroup (DSC: 0.74 ± 0.05 vs 0.70 ± 0.06, P < 0.001; HD: 27.48 mm ± 6.32 vs 38.72 ± 10.69 mm, P < 0.001). The 3D EPV-Net model demonstrated good segmentation accuracy, even for small lesions, supporting its clinical utility for cCRMs evaluation. This automated approach may streamline workflow compared to manual segmentation in cCRMs assessment."

      "title": "Astrocytes in glioblastoma tumor microenvironment.",
      "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) remains one of the most aggressive and lethal brain tumors in adults, characterized by extensive heterogeneity, robust therapeutic resistance, and a dismal prognosis despite maximal surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. A defining hallmark of GBM is its complex tumor microenvironment (TME), a dynamic ecosystem comprising immune cells, vascular networks, extracellular matrix, and various stromal components that collectively drive tumor progression and therapeutic evasion. Within this intricate niche, astrocytes, traditionally regarded as passive support cells in the central nervous system (CNS), have emerged as pivotal orchestrators of GBM pathogenesis. These cells undergo profound phenotypic reprogramming upon interaction with GBM cells, adopting diverse roles that encompass metabolic support, immune suppression, promotion of invasive growth, and induction of therapy resistance. Regulated by key signaling pathways and influenced by GBM-derived exosomes, blood-brain barrier disruption, and tumor-associated hypoxia, astrocytes exhibit remarkable plasticity and heterogeneity, including putative subtypes such as metabolic homeostasis, immune-inflammatory reactive, gliomagenic, and senescence-associated subtypes. Their ability to shape the TME through immunosuppressive axis activation, energy support, metabolic crosstalk, and intercellular communication via tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs) underscores their critical role in GBM biology. This review focuses on the multifaceted contributions of astrocytes within the GBM microenvironment, exploring their phenotypic diversity, regulatory mechanisms, therapeutic potential as emerging targets to dismantle the pro-tumor niche as well as to improve patient outcomes and advances in technologies for investigating astrocytes in GBM."

      "title": "Current advances in the clinical management of Perry syndrome: is there hope for the future?",
      "abstract": "Perry syndrome (PS) is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the DCTN1 gene. It is characterized by parkinsonism, neuropsychiatric symptoms, central hypoventilation, and progressive weight loss, typically leading to a rapid disease course and early death. As genetic testing becomes more widespread, PS is increasingly diagnosed, and its clinical spectrum is expanding. The authors conducted a comprehensive search of public databases through September 2025 to identify original research, conference proceedings, and book chapters related to Perry syndrome. This review summarizes the current understanding of the disease, including its clinical, pathologic, and genetic aspects. The authors also provide practical recommendations for managing symptoms, particularly through optimization of dopaminergic therapy, antidepressive treatment, and noninvasive or invasive ventilation support, which can greatly improve quality of life and extend survival. Although there are currently no approved disease-modifying therapies for PS, recent research into the underlying pathology, such as TDP-43 and axonal transport dysfunction, offers promising targets for future treatments. A new staging system for PS is recommended for PS, which will help to standardize the clinical assessment of PS and guide therapeutic decision-making."

      "title": "Automated Coregistered Segmentation for Volumetric Analysis of Multiparametric Renal MRI.",
      "abstract": "This study aims to develop and evaluate a fully automated deep learning-driven postprocessing pipeline for multiparametric renal MRI, enabling accurate kidney alignment, segmentation, and quantitative feature extraction within a single efficient workflow. Our method has three main stages. First, a segmentation network delineates renal structures in high-contrast images. Next, a deep learning-based pairwise image registration algorithm maps the multiparametric image series to a common target and transfers the predicted annotations between the multiparametric images. Finally, clinically relevant quantitative parameters are extracted through region-specific assessment of renal structure and function based on the aligned and segmented multiparametric data. We used five-fold cross-validation to compare the segmentation outcomes and extracted features with manual analyses in 24 patients with prostate cancer or neuroendocrine tumors and 10 healthy subjects, each undergoing repeated scans. Our automated pipeline achieved high agreement with expert kidney segmentation while delivering significant alignment improvements through registration. Volumetric analysis showed a strong correlation (r  > $$ > $$  0.9) with manual results, and feature extraction demonstrated high intraclass correlation coefficients with minimal bias. The complete processing pipeline, encompassing coregistration, segmentation, and feature extraction, required approximately 15 s per scan from raw input to final quantitative output. The study establishes a reliable automated pipeline for renal multiparametric MRI postprocessing. The achieved accuracy and efficiency can support improved diagnosis and treatment planning for patients with kidney disease."

      "title": "Vaccine literacy among Italian travelers: A web-based survey using a brief assessment tool.",
      "abstract": "The convergence of emerging infectious diseases, accelerating ecological changes, and increasing global mobility makes Vaccine Literacy (VL) a critical component of contemporary travel medicine. Enhanced VL can facilitate more effective provider-traveler communication, ultimately reducing infectious disease transmission risks associated with international travel. This cross-sectional survey aimed to measure VL levels among Italian travelers through an online survey using the 'Vaccine Literacy Brief Tool' (VLBT), a new three-item instrument assessing functional, interactive, and critical dimensions, derived from previously validated measures. Additional study objectives were to explore VL relationships with antecedents, attitudes, and outcomes, as well as to establish the tool's construct and criterion validity within the traveler population. Enrollment was conducted through a QR code displayed at nine vaccination clinics across five Italian regions, linking to an anonymous questionnaire (Google Forms) that visiting travelers could voluntarily access and complete before receiving vaccination for their trip. In addition to VL skills, the psychological antecedents of Vaccine Hesitancy (VH), the \"3Cs\" (confidence, complacency, convenience) were assessed. Additional measures included demographic and travel-related variables, as well as behavioral, cognitive and intentional vaccination outcomes. A total of 534 questionnaires were collected between January and July 2025. Participants showed a mean VL score of 3.07 ± 0.66 on a four-point Likert scale, significantly lower than the 3.21 ± 0.42 reported in previous general population studies (p < .001). The mean 3Cs score was 1.92 ± 0.60, indicating relatively high VH levels. VL and 3Cs scores showed a significant negative correlation (r = -0.204, P < .001). Participants consisted primarily of highly educated adults aged 18-40 years. VL scores were negatively associated with younger age (ρ = -0.132, p = .002), and positively with higher educational level (ρ = 0196, p < .001), higher income (ρ = 0.145, p < .001), greater number of information sources consulted (r = 0.104, p = .016), and more favorable vaccination outcomes. Conversely, the 3Cs demonstrated inverse significant relationships with the same demographic and behavioral variables. No significant gender differences emerged for either VL or 3Cs measures. Construct validity of the VLBT was supported by the significant negative correlation between VL and 3Cs scores, and with additional confirmation provided through reliability tests and factor analyses. Criterion validity was demonstrated through significant associations between VL scores and vaccination behaviors: number of vaccines received, vaccination recall accuracy, awareness of destination-specific pre-travel vaccination requirements, and influenza vaccination intention. Mediation analysis revealed that the 3Cs partially mediated the relationship between VL and specific vaccination intention outcomes, while demographic characteristics (age, income) and travel-related factors (number of information sources) significantly moderated these associations. The VLBT assessed travelers' VL levels through three simple questions and demonstrated potential clinical utility in travel medicine. By facilitating identification of individuals with limited literacy levels, the new tool can help providers orientate the discussion for a profitable counseling session. Implementation research is needed to confirm its effectiveness in routine travel clinical practice. The high VH revealed in the traveler population warrants future targeted research."

      "title": "Cognitive processes and emotion perception in frontotemporal dementia.",
      "abstract": "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) can cause cognitive impairments and disrupt the ability to perceive others' emotions. We examined whether cognitive impairments in semantic knowledge and executive function are related to two aspects of emotion perception. Individuals with FTD and healthy controls (N = 110; 33 behavioral variant FTD, 23 non-fluent variant FTD, 30 semantic variant FTD, and 24 controls) completed neuropsychological tests of semantic word knowledge (Peabody Picture Vocabulary, Boston Naming Tests) and executive function (Digit Span Backwards, Trail-Making, Stroop, Design Fluency). They also completed two behavioral tests of emotion perception (1) an emotion labeling task that measured the ability to identify specific emotions (e.g. sad, happy) of characters in films and (2) an emotion tracking task that measures the ability to continuously track the emotional valence (i.e. negative, neutral, positive) of a character in a film. Lower semantic word knowledge was associated with less accurate emotion labeling (but was not associated with emotion tracking). In contrast, lower executive function was associated with lower accuracy in both labeling and tracking. Effects were robust even after accounting for diagnosis, age, sex, global cognition, and dementia severity. Findings reveal how distinct cognitive processes are linked with different aspects of emotion perception in FTD."
